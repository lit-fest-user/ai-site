            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>
                In November 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a chatbot based on the GPT-3 family of large language models (LLM). ChatGPT gained worldwide attention following its release, becoming a viral Internet sensation.[4] Alarmed by ChatGPT's potential threat to Google Search, Google executives issued a "code red" alert, reassigning several teams to assist in the company's artificial intelligence (AI) efforts.[5] Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google and parent company Alphabet, was widely reported to have issued the alert, but Pichai later denied this to The New York Times.[6] In a rare and unprecedented move, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who had stepped down from their roles as co-CEOs of Alphabet in 2019, were summoned to emergency meetings with company executives to discuss Google's response to ChatGPT.[7] Earlier that year, the company had unveiled LaMDA, a prototype LLM,[8][9] but did not release it to the public.[10] When asked by employees at an all-hands meeting whether LaMDA was a missed opportunity for Google to compete with ChatGPT, Pichai and Google AI chief Jeff Dean stated that while the company had similar capabilities to ChatGPT, moving too quickly in that arena would represent a major "reputational risk" due to Google being substantially larger than OpenAI.[11][12] In January 2023, DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis hinted at plans for a ChatGPT rival,[13] and Google employees were instructed to accelerate progress on a ChatGPT competitor, intensively testing "Apprentice Bard" and other chatbots.[14][15] Pichai assured investors during Google's quarterly earnings investor call in February that the company had plans to expand LaMDA's availability and applications.

            <h2>Training</h2>

            <p>
                    The fine-tuning was accomplished using human trainers to improve the model's performance and, in the case of supervised learning, the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement learning stage, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation.[10] These rankings were used to create "reward models" that were used to fine-tune the model further by using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).[11][12]

                    Time magazine revealed that to build a safety system against harmful content (e.g. sexual abuse, violence, racism, sexism, etc.), OpenAI used outsourced Kenyan workers earning less than $2 per hour to label harmful content. These labels were used to train a model to detect such content in the future. The outsourced laborers were exposed to "toxic" and traumatic content; one worker described the assignment as "torture". OpenAI's outsourcing partner was Sama, a training-data company based in San Francisco, California.[13]
                    
                    ChatGPT initially used a Microsoft Azure supercomputing infrastructure, powered by Nvidia GPUs, that Microsoft built specifically for OpenAI and that reportedly cost "hundreds of millions of dollars". Following the success of ChatGPT, Microsoft dramatically upgraded the OpenAI infrastructure in 2023.[14]
                    
                    OpenAI collects data from ChatGPT users to train and fine-tune the service further. Users can upvote or downvote responses they receive from ChatGPT and fill in a text field with additional feedback.[15][16]
                    
                    ChatGPT's training data includes software manual pages, information about internet phenomena such as bulletin board systems, and multiple programming languages.[17] Wikipedia was also one of the sources of training data for ChatGPT.

            <h2>Basic Service</h2>
            <p>
                    ChatGPT was launched on November 30, 2022, by San Francisco–based OpenAI (the creator of the initial GPT series of large language models; DALL·E 2, a diffusion model used to generate images; and Whisper, a speech transcription model). The service was initially free to the public and the company had plans to monetize the service later.[41] By December 4, 2022, ChatGPT had over one million users.[15] In January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million users, making it the fastest growing consumer application to date.[42] A Pew Research poll conducted in March 2023 found that 14% of American adults had tried ChatGPT.[43]

                    The service works best in English but also functions in some other languages, to varying degrees of accuracy.[22] No official peer-reviewed paper on ChatGPT has been published.[44] As of April 2023, ChatGPT is blocked by China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. In addition, ChatGPT geofences itself to avoid doing business in Iran, North Korea, and Russia.[45]
                    
                    The company provides a tool, called "AI classifier for indicating AI-written text",[46] that attempts to determine whether a text has been written by an AI such as ChatGPT. OpenAI cautions that the tool will "likely yield a lot of false positives and negatives, sometimes with great confidence."
